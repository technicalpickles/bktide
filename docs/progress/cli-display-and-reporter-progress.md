### CLI Display & Reporter ‚Äì Progress Log

This document tracks changes, deferrals, and next actions while implementing the plan in `docs/planning/cli-display-and-reporter-plan.md` and the CLI UX audit in `docs/planning/cli-ux-audit-implementation.md`.

#### Phase 0 ‚Äì Baseline UX & Safety
Status: Completed (with deferral)

Done
- Enabled Commander suggestions for mistyped commands via `program.showSuggestionAfterError()`.
- Added global `--color <mode>` option with `auto|always|never` and environment handling for `NO_COLOR`.
- Built and validated TypeScript compilation.

Deferred
- Change to error routing (plain ‚Üí stderr). We decided to keep current error handling unchanged for now.

Notes
- `--color` flag is plumbed; actual color usage will be introduced with theme/reporter in Phase 1.

#### Phase 1 ‚Äì Theme and Reporter
Status: Completed

Planned
- Add `src/ui/theme.ts` exporting `COLORS` and `SYMBOLS` with TTY-aware color helpers.
- Add `src/ui/reporter.ts` providing `info/success/warn/error` and `table(rows)` utilities, guarded for `json|alfred`.
- Minimal integration: use reporter for a single success confirmation in `pipelines` command when `--format plain`.

Applied so far
- Added `theme.ts` and `reporter.ts`.
- Integrated reporter confirmations into: `pipelines`, `orgs`, `viewer`, `builds`, `annotations` (plain only).
- Verified via `bin/bktide`:
  - `--help` shows `--color` and suggestions enabled.
  - `pipelines --format plain` shows `‚úì Pipelines retrieved` and data output.
  - `orgs --format plain` shows `‚úì Organizations retrieved` and org list.
  - `viewer --format plain` shows `‚úì Viewer info loaded` and viewer details.
  - `builds --count 3 --format plain` shows `‚úì Builds retrieved` and build list.
  - `token --check` works unchanged; reporter remains silent for token command.
  - `boom --type basic --format plain` behavior unchanged.

Notes
- Planning doc updated with Phase 1 application checklist and a testing matrix covering confirmations across commands and formats.
- Reporter remains silent for `json` and `alfred` formats by design.

#### Phase 2 ‚Äì Table Utility Adoption
Status: Completed

Applied so far
- Plain pipelines output now uses aligned columns (NAME, SLUG) when a single org is targeted; (ORGANIZATION, NAME, SLUG) when multiple orgs.
- Plain builds output now uses a tabular summary (PIPELINE, NUMBER, STATE, BRANCH) for improved scan-ability.
- Plain organizations output now uses a NAME/SLUG table.

Validation
- `bin/bktide pipelines --format plain | head -n 20` shows aligned headings and rows.
- `bin/bktide builds --count 5 --format plain | head -n 30` shows aligned tabular summary.

Next
- `viewer`: keep as-is; table not beneficial for 2‚Äì3 labeled lines.
- `annotations`: keep as-is; content is multi-line text bodies, tables not appropriate.
- Monitor wrapping for extremely long names; consider truncation/ellipsis if needed.

#### Phase 3 ‚Äì TTY-Gated Spinners
Status: Completed

Applied so far
- Added `src/ui/spinner.ts` (TTY-only, silent for json/alfred).
- Integrated spinner into `pipelines`, `builds`, `orgs`, `viewer`, and `annotations` for long-running fetches.
- Spinner clears on completion (no residual frames); Reporter prints the single success line.

Validation
- Verified spinners are visible only in TTY and do not emit in json/alfred or when piped.

#### Phase 4 ‚Äì Cleanup & Consistency
Status: Completed

Applied so far
- Centralized table rendering via `src/ui/table.ts`; refactored plain formatters (pipelines/builds/orgs).
- Removed inline ANSI from error paths; plain error formatter uses theme; CLI error helper prints neutral text.
- Adopted error stream routing: plain errors ‚Üí stderr; json/alfred errors ‚Üí stdout.

Validation
- `boom --type basic --format plain 1>out 2>err` leaves stdout empty and writes error to stderr.
- `boom --type basic --format json 1>out 2>err` writes JSON to stdout only; stderr empty.

Decisions
- Keep `ManageToken` without reporter/spinner to avoid UX duplication.

## CLI UX Audit Implementation Progress

### Week 1: Quick Wins & Core Improvements

#### Quick Wins (Not yet started)
- [ ] Unify exit handling (process.exit() vs process.exitCode)
- [x] Add `--quiet` flag (completed in Phase 0)
- [ ] ASCII symbol fallback (partially done - symbols exist, need --ascii flag integration)
- [ ] Improve CI/spinner detection

#### Core Improvements (High Impact, Medium Effort) - Completed ‚úÖ
Status: All three core improvements completed

**1. Width-Aware Tables** ‚úÖ
- Updated `src/ui/table.ts` to use width utilities
- Tables automatically adjust to terminal width
- Implemented intelligent column width calculation and text truncation
- Responsive behavior ensures readability in narrow terminals

**2. Structured Error Templates** ‚úÖ
- Completely redesigned `src/formatters/errors/PlainTextFormatter.ts`
- Errors display in clear sections: ERROR, CAUSE, DETAILS, STACK, HINTS
- Added contextual hints based on error type:
  - Authentication errors ‚Üí token management suggestions
  - Network errors ‚Üí connectivity troubleshooting
  - Permission errors ‚Üí access verification steps
  - Rate limit errors ‚Üí retry strategies
- Wrapped error messages for better readability
- Used semantic symbols and colors for visual hierarchy

**3. Next-Steps Hints** ‚úÖ
- Added success hints to `ManageToken` command:
  - After storing token: suggests verifying access and exploring orgs/pipelines
- Added contextual hints to `ListBuilds` command:
  - Suggests increasing count when limit is reached
  - Shows available filter options when no filters are active
- Improved discoverability through helpful suggestions

#### Bonus Improvements (Not in original plan)

**4. TTY Detection Fix** üéÅ
- Fixed issue where decorative messages appeared when piping output
- Reporter properly detects non-TTY stdout and suppresses decorative output
- Tables and actual data preserved, only decorative elements hidden
- Ensures clean output when piping through `head`, `grep`, etc.

**5. Tips System Implementation** üéÅ
- Added `--tips` and `--no-tips` flags for fine-grained control
- Smart defaults: tips shown by default, `--quiet` implies `--no-tips`
- Override capability: `--quiet --tips` shows tips but not success messages
- New `tip()` method in Reporter for semantic clarity
- TTY-aware: tips hidden when piping regardless of flags

#### Testing Completed
- ‚úÖ Width-aware tables tested with pipelines command
- ‚úÖ Structured errors tested with `boom` command (API and basic errors)
- ‚úÖ Next-steps hints tested with token storage and builds listing
- ‚úÖ TTY detection verified with piped commands (`| head`)
- ‚úÖ Tips system tested with various flag combinations

### Week 2: Polish (Completed)

#### Width-Aware Help Text ‚úÖ
- Created `src/ui/help.ts` with custom `WidthAwareHelp` class extending Commander's Help
- Automatically wraps help text based on terminal width (capped at 100 chars for readability)
- Handles option descriptions and command descriptions intelligently
- Integrated into main program via `configureHelp()`

#### Color-Blind Safe Palette ‚úÖ
- Updated `src/ui/theme.ts` with accessible color scheme:
  - Orange (rgb(255, 140, 0)) for errors instead of red
  - Blue for success instead of green
  - Yellow for warnings (universally visible)
  - Cyan for info (good contrast)
- Added explanatory comments about accessibility considerations
- All colored output includes semantic labels (ERROR, SUCCESS, WARNING)

#### Progress Bars ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive `src/ui/progress.ts` with:
  - Unified `Progress` class with factory methods (`spinner()`, `bar()`, `create()`)
  - Consistent `IProgress` interface for all indicator types
  - `Spinner` class for indeterminate progress (animated)
  - `Bar` class for determinate progress (with percentage and counts)
  - Helper functions `withProgress()` for async operations
  - TTY-aware (hidden in pipes, CI, and machine formats)
  - Responsive to terminal width
  - Clean clearing without residual artifacts
- Integrated into ALL commands:
  - Token validation: Progress bar for 3 checks √ó N organizations
  - Multi-org builds: Progress bar showing org-by-org fetching
  - Pipeline pagination: Mixed approach (determinate for orgs, indeterminate for pages)
  - Single operations: Spinner for viewer, orgs, annotations
- **Progress API Refactoring** (completed):
  - Unified interface via `Progress` class factory methods
  - Migrated ALL commands from `createSpinner()` to `Progress.spinner()`
  - Eliminated code duplication between Spinner and IndeterminateProgress
  - Removed obsolete `src/ui/spinner.ts` compatibility layer
  - Removed test file `src/commands/TestProgress.ts`
  - Backward compatibility maintained via wrapper classes
  - Full documentation in `docs/progress-api.md`

### Week 3: Testing & Documentation (Next)
- [ ] Snapshot testing for output stability
- [ ] Documentation updates for new flags and behaviors
- [ ] Update README with new features
- [ ] Create migration guide for users

### Week 4: Rollout & Monitoring (Upcoming)
