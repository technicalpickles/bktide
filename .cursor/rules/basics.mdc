This is a typescript CLI for interacting with the Buildkite GraphQL API.

# Running commands

Assume you are in the correct directory, ie the root of the repository. Don't try cd'ing to it

Some noteable commands, as defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json):

- `npm run build` 
- `npm run start` to execute the script, which passes args to the CLI


# Making changes

When updating things like [queries.ts](mdc:src/graphql/queries.ts), make sure to update callsites that are using it.


# GraphQL

Make sure queries stay in [queries.ts](mdc:src/graphql/queries.ts) . Calls to the API should go through [BuildkiteClient.ts](mdc:src/services/BuildkiteClient.ts)
